This is a fork of the 2016 ACC Manuscript long version. 

https://github.com/skulumani/2016_acc_manuscript/tree/long_version

We're modifying/expanding it for submission to IJCAS

## To regenerate the plots

All of the data/code used for the simulation and experiment is located at:

* [FDCL IJCAS Code Repo](https://github.com/fdcl-gwu/2016_IJCAS_code)
* [Shankar IJCAS Code Repo](https://github.com/skulumani/2016_IJCAS_code)

Both repos should be essentially the but sometimes I will forget to  push to one or the other.

The code is written in both Python and Matlab and either can be used to regenerate the figures.
More details are available in that repository.
